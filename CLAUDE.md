# Hrček extension — working agreement

Browser extension clients for the Hrček link-saving service. Firefox
ships first; Chrome and Safari build from the same code. The server
lives in `../hrcek` — its API guide is `../hrcek/docs/dev/api.md`, its
error codes `../hrcek/docs/dev/error-codes.md`, and its OpenAPI schema
is vendored here at `docs/api/openapi.json`.

Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-hrcek-extension-design.md`.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — run in real Firefox with auto-reload (primary target)
- `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:watch` — unit + contract tests (Vitest)
- `pnpm test:e2e` — builds the e2e Chrome target, runs Playwright
  against the in-repo fake Hrček (`tests/fake-hrcek/`)
- `HRCEK_URL=… HRCEK_TOKEN=… pnpm vitest run tests/contract/real.test.ts`
  — contract tests against a real, locally running Hrček (opt-in)
- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` — must pass before any commit; the
  `.githooks/pre-commit` hook runs these plus `pnpm test` and refuses
  the commit if any fails. `pnpm install` installs the hook (the
  `prepare` script points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks`). The
  end-to-end suite is too slow for the hook and runs in CI instead.
- `pnpm build` / `pnpm zip` — Firefox production build / AMO zip
- `pnpm refresh-schema` — re-vendor `openapi.json` from `../hrcek` and
  regenerate `src/lib/api/types.gen.ts`. Run when the server API changes.

## Architecture rules

- **`src/lib/` never imports from `src/entrypoints/`.** All reusable
  logic (API client, auth, settings, save flow) lives in `lib/`;
  entrypoints are thin DOM wiring.
- **Browser-specific code climbs a ladder — always use the lowest rung
  that works:** (1) per-browser manifest config in `wxt.config.ts`;
  (2) `import.meta.env.FIREFOX`-style build-time switches;
  (3) a platform module in `src/lib/platform/` behind a shared
  interface; (4) per-browser entrypoints. Adding a browser must be a
  build target, not a port.
- `src/lib/api/types.gen.ts` is generated — never edit it by hand.

## API gotchas (they bite)

- `POST /api/entries/` is an upsert: 201 created, 200 updated. It
  REPLACES the entry — omitted attributes are cleared — EXCEPT
  `fields`, which is PATCHED (send `""` to clear one field; omitting
  `fields` changes none of them).
- Always look before writing: `GET /api/entries/by-url/` (404 +
  `HRC-CORE-0003` means not held). The popup does this on open.
- Branch on error `code`, never on `message` — messages are translated
  and may be reworded. Show `message` to people, though.
- Never hard-code field names. `Price`/`Priority` are only the defaults
  of a fresh account; fields are per-account, renameable, deletable.
- Addresses match on trimmed whitespace + lowercased scheme/host and
  nothing else: a trailing slash or `www.` is a different address.

## Security rules

- The API token lives in `browser.storage.local` only — never
  `storage.sync` (unencrypted, replicated).
- The password is NEVER persisted anywhere. It is used once for
  `POST /api/auth/tokens`, which returns a token; only the token is kept.
- **Bearer tokens are the only credential.** Session authentication is
  not an option for an extension: Django checks the `Origin` header
  before the CSRF token, and `moz-extension://<uuid>` can never be a
  trusted origin (the uuid differs per install). The client therefore
  sends `credentials: 'omit'` everywhere and holds no `cookies`
  permission. Do not reintroduce session auth.
- Minting a token is deliberately anonymous — the server refuses to mint
  one for a request that presents a token, so a leaked token cannot
  issue its own replacement.
- The manifest requires no host permissions; the configured server's
  origin is requested at runtime from the options page. Only the
  `--mode e2e` build adds localhost host permissions, for Playwright.

## Testing expectations

- TDD: behavior changes start with a failing test. Unit tests are
  colocated (`*.test.ts` next to the source).
- The fake Hrček (`tests/fake-hrcek/server.ts`) is typed against the
  generated schema and mirrors documented behavior including error
  codes; when the server API changes, update fake + tests together
  with `pnpm refresh-schema`.
- Production zips must contain no test code — WXT only bundles
  entrypoints; keep test files out of `src/entrypoints/` imports.
- e2e runs in Chromium (Playwright cannot load Firefox extensions);
  Firefox is covered by unit tests plus `pnpm dev` smoke checks.
- Tests gate twice: the pre-commit hook locally, and CI on every pull
  request and push to `main`. Never commit with `--no-verify` to dodge
  a failing test — fix the test or the code.

## Before AMO submission (future)

- Replace the placeholder gecko id in `wxt.config.ts`.
- Add real icons.
